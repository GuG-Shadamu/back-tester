# Idea

## Data processing and storage (Python)

Python is excellent for handling large datasets and data manipulation tasks, as it has a rich ecosystem of libraries for these purposes, such as pandas and NumPy. You can use Python to preprocess, clean, and store historical stock/FX data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, SQLite, or other database systems).

## Event-driven architecture and scheduling (Python)

Python is well-suited for designing the event-driven architecture of your backtesting system, which includes event queues, event handling, and scheduling. You can use Python's asyncio library for handling asynchronous events or other third-party libraries like Celery for handling distributed task queues.

## Strategy implementation and execution (Python)

Python's flexibility and readability make it a popular choice for implementing trading strategies. You can define your trading strategies, entry and exit rules, and risk management techniques in Python. This way, you can take advantage of the extensive libraries and tools available in Python for financial analysis, such as TA-Lib for technical analysis and statsmodels for statistical analysis.

## Performance-critical components (C++)

For the performance-critical components of your system, such as backtesting engine, order execution, and performance metrics calculation, you can leverage the speed and efficiency of C++. This will allow you to perform high-speed backtesting and optimization of your strategies.

## Interfacing between Python and C++ (Python/C++)

To enable seamless interaction between Python and C++ components, you can use tools like Boost.Python, pybind11, or the Python C-API. These tools allow you to expose C++ functions and classes to Python, enabling efficient communication between the two languages.

## Visualization and reporting (Python)

Once your backtesting is complete, you'll want to visualize and analyze the results. Python's extensive library ecosystem, such as Matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly, can help you create interactive plots and dashboards to better understand the performance of your trading strategies. Additionally, you can use Python to generate reports in various formats, like PDF or HTML, using libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint.

# Infra

## Data Storage and Retrieval

- Data Source: Obtain historical stock/FX data from external sources (e.g., APIs, CSV files, or databases).
- Data Processing (Python): Clean, preprocess, and store the data using **Polars**.
- Data Storage: Save the processed data in an efficient storage format, such as CSV, SQLite, or other database systems.

## Event-Driven Framework (Python)

- Event Queue: Implement an event queue to store and manage events (e.g., market data updates, trading signals, order events).
- Event Handlers: Create event handler functions to process different types of events (e.g., strategy updates, order execution, performance calculations).
- Event Scheduler: Implement an event scheduler that determines when events should be processed and handles them accordingly, using asyncio or other scheduling libraries.

## Strategy Implementation (Python)

- Strategy Classes: Define trading strategies, entry/exit rules, and risk management techniques using Python classes and methods.
- Indicator Library: Utilize libraries such as TA-Lib for technical analysis and statsmodels for statistical analysis.
Backtesting Engine (C++):
- Market Simulation: Implement a market simulation to replicate historical market conditions for backtesting.
- Order Execution: Implement order execution logic, accounting for slippage, commissions, and other trading costs.
- Performance Metrics: Calculate key performance metrics, such as P&L, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and position sizing, using C++ for efficiency.

## Interfacing between Python and C++

- Interfacing Tools: Use Boost.Python, pybind11, or the Python C-API to expose C++ functions and classes to Python, enabling communication between the two languages.

## Visualization and Reporting (Python)

- Visualization: Use Matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, or other visualization libraries to create interactive plots and dashboards.
- Reporting: Generate reports in various formats, such as PDF or HTML, using libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint.
